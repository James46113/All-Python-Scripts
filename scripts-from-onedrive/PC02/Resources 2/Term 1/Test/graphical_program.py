# Create a ButtonClicker class that contains the following instance variables
# - A window with the title "Button Clicker"
# - A label that shows "Click on Buttons to Enter Password"
# - 4 Buttons under the label, each shown horizontally from left to right, with text "Button 1" to "Button 4"
# =   Add the same click listener to each button that retrieves the button's text and adds it to a list
# =   It then checks the list against a hard coded list of 4 values: "Button 2", "Button 4", "Button 1", "Button 3"
# =   If they match, change the label to "Correct Password Entered"
# =   If they don't when the list has 4 elements, remove all the elements from the list so the user can try again
# Define the following functions too
# - A start function that runs the main loop of the window


# Instantiate a ButtonClicker and start it
